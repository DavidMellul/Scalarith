# Scalarith

A basic expression interpreter made with Scala.

This project has been made in order to train the basics of Parsing with Scala.

This expression parser supports :
- The four basic operations : + \ - \ * \ /
- The power operation : x^y 
- The parenthesis priority : (a+b)*c
- The operations priority : multiplication and division are prior to addition and substraction
- The trigonometry functions : cos() / sin() / tan() / arcos() / arcsin() / arctan()
- The exponential function : e^x
- The power of 10 operator : 1E5 = 1 * 10 ^5 = 100 000
- The imbricated functions : cos ( sin ( tan ( cos ( 0 ) ) ) ) ^ E^(5*6)
